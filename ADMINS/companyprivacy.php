<h5 style="color:#000">Cancellation policy</h5>

<p style="color:#000">The cancellation terms are different for each bus operator and are set by the bus operator itself. These terms are shown while booking as well as on the ticket printout/Email confirmation.<br>
The cut-off time for canceling a bus ticket depends on either bus start time/boarding point time/bus origin start time. For example: If the bus is scheduled to start from Origin Place at 4 PM and scheduled to reach your en-route selected city at 8 PM and scheduled to reach your selected boarding point at 8:15 PM then the Bus Origin Start Time is 4 PM, Bus Start Time is 8 PM and Boarding Point Time is 8:15 PM.<br>
Please read the cancellation terms provided in the search page against each bus service.<br>
Tickets booked online should be cancelled online only.<br>
AbhiBus.com will charge Rs.15 as a cancellation fee other than what the bus operator charges for every seat cancelled.<br>
Cancellation charges are applicable on original fare but not on the discounted fare. The cancellation charges are deducted from the collected/discounted fare and the balance is refunded. [For example: If the original ticket fare is Rs.1000 and your discounted fare is Rs.900, the cancellation charges are calculated on the original fare. i.e., on Rs.1000. So if the cancellation charges are 10%, your refund amount would be Rs.900-100 - 15 = Rs.785.<br>
Some of the operators accept Partial Cancellation. Please go through the Cancellation Terms in the Ticket.<br>
Preponement or Postponement cannot be done once ticket is confirmed.<br>
a) If service is cancelled by APSRTC for any reason, customer should cancel the ticket within 15 days from the date of journey to get full refund.<br>
b) Cancellation of such tickets is not allowed after 15 days from the date of journey.<br>
